# Wrapup 

In this project we have been able to explore and visualise multiple new datasets. We have created plots including radar plots, bar charts and heatmaps using both code adapted from sources on the internet and written ourselves. We also tried graph visualisation techniques and discussed the problems inherent with analysing found cybersecurity data.

## Project aims 

1. To gain experience with the assessment used.


From the lectures we get a first insight into the main content of the course and some primary data analysis. From the workshop, we learned about Rstudio and how to write a document using markdown, and we learned how to use Github and we used it for the first time for teamwork.

From the data sources provided by assessment, we have identified a number of sources where cyber security related data is available. These sources allow us to analyse different types of cyber security data, and in this assessment we have used some of the data from data sources. Finally, with assessment we get a first glimpse of cyber security data, such as the different data types.


2. To explore collaborative working


All three people in the group are using GitHub for the first time to collaborate. We found some of the GitHub features ideal for collaboration, such as the ability to edit text in full using Markdown and the ability for many people to work under one project and see their respective progress. As well as working together online through GitHub, we also meet offline every week for a more productive exchange where we can share our views on the project.


3. To gain additional experience with programming.


For python, pandas and numpy are used for the data analysed, and matplotlib is used for the drawing. python is powerful with these libraries and can produce satisfactory visualisations of the data.


In some cases, we have had to borrow code from the internet for data processing processes that we were not familiar with. When borrowing some code from the web, sometimes this code needs some refinement to fit our data set. In the process it also deepened our impression of the unfamiliar code.


When first processing this data, we found that most of the cyber security datasets were quite large and in some cases importing all the data would cause the program to crash. So, we have also learned some ways to handle huge data sets, such as removing some unnecessary data or importing the data part by part.

Sometimes there is data in a dataset that we cannot use directly, for example, sometimes timestamps are processed as time intervals, or data is counted for each connection.


## Discussion of intended topics

### What are the broad types of data?
* KDD data which contains 42 variables including numerical, int and char data
* Bro logs dataset which contains each network connection including various data type like numerical, int and char.
* We also found datasets focussed on classifying types of malware.


### What are the main types of resource and what type of problems can the resources solve?

* Most of the examples of code on cybersecurity data we found were on public github repositories, and we found that most of this was coded using Python. 
* Other groups projects can be found on github which is quite useful for us as a good inspiration to deal with dataset and do some visualization based on the knowledge we learned before.
* Github is useful for us to do collaborative coding.
* Useful articles and dataset can be found online. By looking through them, we get more deep understanding about anomaly detection, classification of malware, indicators of attacks and visualising networks.  


### Are there any generic data science resources that might be applicable? In what sense are they applicable?
We found that there are a huge number of websites and repositories dedicated to data visualisation methods for different types of variable which can easily be adapted and applied to cybersecurity data. These are applicable in this setting, as for example with the radar plots, many online resources give ideas for how to visualise multiple variables at the same time, and in addition these resources helped us to find packages which produce more professional looking charts.
