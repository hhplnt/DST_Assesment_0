# Wrapup 

In this project we have been able to explore and visualise multiple new datasets. We have created plots including radar plots, bar charts and heatmaps using both code adapted from sources on the internet and written ourselves. We also tried graph visualisation techniques and discussed the problems inherent with analysing found cybersecurity data.

## Project aims 
* How we met the three aims
1. To give you experience with the assessment used
* oppurtunity to look through examples in detail
From the data sources provided by assessment, we have identified a number of sources where cyber security related data is available. These sources allow us to analyse different types of cyber security data, and in this assessment we have used some of the data from data sources.
2. To enable you to explore collaborative working,
* Learning to use github
3. To give you additional experience with programming.
* writing code
* borrowing/adapting code from the internet
* loading in big/ awkward data
* transforming data


## Discussion of intended topics

### What are the broad types of data?
* kdd, bro logs, 

We also found datasets focussed on classifying types of malware.

### What are the main types of resource and what type of problems can the resources solve?
Most of the examples of code on cybersecurity data we found were on public github repositories, and we found that most of this was coded using Python. 

* most code in python
* other groups projects
* github
* anomaly detection, classification of malware, indicators of attacks, visualising networks  


### Are there any generic data science resources that might be applicable? In what sense are they applicable?
We found that there are a huge number of websites and repositories dedicated to data visualisation methods for different types of variable which can easily be adapted and applied to cybersecurity data. These are applicable in this setting, as for example with the radar plots, many online resources give ideas for how to visualise multiple variables at the same time, and in addition these resources helped us to find packages which produce more professional looking charts.

### How is the experience of sharing code via GitHub limiting, and/or enabling?
* We are all new to collaborative coding, getting used to github
