#DST Assessment 0

## Introduction

In this first project, we had 3 main aims:

* To gain experience with the style of group assessments
* To explore collaborative working
* To gain additional experience with programming and using real data.

We were tasked with conducting a literature review on our chosen application domain, which in our case is cybersecurity.

In particular, we were asked to investigate the following questions:

* What are the broad types of data?
* What are the main types of resource?
* What type of problems can the resources solve?
* Are there any generic data science resources that might be applicable? In what sense are they applicable?
* How is the experience of sharing code via GitHub limiting, and/or enabling?

We chose to explore these ideas through the implemetation a variety of visualisation techniques to expand on the main topic of our first block of lectures. 

This is a 3 person team; Hannah, Hailey and Jiang. Hannah and Hailey have previous experience programming in R, whereas Jiang has previous experience in Python. Due to the short time for the project we decided to stick to these languages and divide the work accordingly.
