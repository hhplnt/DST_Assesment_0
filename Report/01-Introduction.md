#DST Assessment 0

## Introduction

In this first project, we had 3 main aims:

* To gain experience with the style of group assessments
* To explore collaborative working
* To gain additional experience with programming and using real data.

We were tasked with conducting a literature review on our chosen application domain, which in our case is cybersecurity.

In particular, we were asked to investigate the following questions:

* What are the broad types of data?
* What are the main types of resource?
* What type of problems can the resources solve?
* Are there any generic data science resources that might be applicable? In what sense are they applicable?
* How might the approach be compared to other approaches, and/or applied across different datasets?
* How is the experience of sharing code via GitHub limiting, and/or enabling?
